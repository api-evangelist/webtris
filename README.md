# WebTRISThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [WebTRIS APIs](http://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [WebTRIS APIs](http://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/)- [Developer](http://webtris.highwaysengland.co.uk/)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/webtris/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the WebTRIS APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
